# BATCH_FILE_VERSION_CHECK
This BATCH File code is intended to be used at the start of any of your BATCH files that you host on GitHub. It will perform a check each time it is Launched to see if there is a new version on GitHub to be downloaded prior to use.
For this to work, your BAT file needs to have no spaces in the file name.
